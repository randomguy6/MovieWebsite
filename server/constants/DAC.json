    "year": 2018,
    "rating": 3.5,
    "review": "So this movie took me about a day and a half to finish. Part of that is from how long the movie (that and college exams don't write themselves). Normally I don't have a problem with how long the movie is as long as I don't feel it, like Endgame and a lot of Indian movies. You can definitely feel the length of the movie. There are several scenes that could either be shortened or just cut out of the movie. This really is the main reason why I don't see myself watching this movie every so often.\nThat being said. The cinematography was gorgeous to look at. There are shots in the movie that just looked utterly amazing, especially how the colors popped in those scenes. Coming into this movie, I was expecting a violent grindhouse movie with Mel Gibson and Vince Vaughn in the spotlight, which it was don't get me wrong. However, Tory Kittles, whom I've never seen before, was so amazing in this role. Everyone else is great, but man Tory Kittles stood out the most from the others. I also loved the story and direction, especially how the movie ended and how we see both Mel Gibson's and Tory Kittle's arcs. There are definitely disturbing scenes in here and loved how those scenes weren't held back in any way. Overall it's a great film whose runtime just killed part of the movie."
