const aboutState = "Hey there, I am Sai Donepudi. I am currently a final year computer science student at Colorado State University. Since I’m more preoccupied with school and life in general, I often watch movies to distract myself with what I normally should be doing. Since I watch movies way too often, I made this site to show what I think about movies and some occasional rants. I also made this site in order to further improve my skills in web development. I made this site from scratch so there might be some odd design choices (especially on mobile since I realized we use browsers on phones and didn’t really optimize it to look nice on a mobile screen).";
const mission = "As previously mentioned, I wanted to expand my skill set in web development. I wanted to apply what I learned from my internship to this website to see what I can do. This website serves as a purpose of how well I can develop and maintain this website (if more people go on this site often). This site also serves a means to voice my opinion on movies and behaviors in the movie industry, especially Indian movies. This is a project that I have been waiting to work on. And since we are in a middle of a pandemic right now (as of August 2020), I thought this was a perfect opportunity to start working on this before college starts.";
